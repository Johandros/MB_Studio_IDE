This update is just a preview for the upcoming Marnid Update - MountBlade Studio v3.2
which I will release in February depending on the time and motivation I have.

As you can see I added some tutorial messages and new features.
In the final update there will hopefully be some more.

The face editor was asked for as a new feature and I added it.
But at the moment it is only for the basic face editing,
such as hair, beard, hair/beard color, skin and age.
In the it should have the same ability as the ingame face editor.

Have a good time and I hope there aren't too many bugs in the stable version.
Some bugs related to the object list and other minor problems should be fixed in the preview version.
