This update fixed many module system code bugs and also removed the need of 
creating source files to compile the changes.

The tutorials are still missing, but in case there aren't too many bugs left 
which I didn't find yet, I could use my time
to create some tutorials and also new "Managers".

The first Managers where hard-coded, but because I wanted to make this a little 
bit more transparent, the future ones won't be hard-coded.
If want to know more about it, take a look in the Manager folder inside your 
MB Studio installation folder.

As you can see on top of this changelog, this build is called "Klethi". 
I decided to call my feature updates after Mount&Blade charaters and started 
with this one.

In the future I probably will add some community features too, because at the 
moment the only way users can contact me is via ModDB.
These features would allow you to write some short feedback messages and 
bugreports or maybe some voting etc.

I hope you like this tool and you are able to make something out of it in the future!


Have fun!

Johandros
